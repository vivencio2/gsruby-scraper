# Getting started with Ruby
This is a challenge project to get started with Ruby and also how quickly I can learn a new programming language. I did this in 6 days and 3 days of that are weekdays and can only work at night.
My strategy is just to code as I learn and highly biased on how we code on .NET. I'm still figuring out to properly to do if statements the Ruby way and honestly I struggle with that.


## Technologies used :
1. Ruby
2. Sinatra - micro web framework of Ruby
3. Redis

## Ruby Gems used:
1. Nokogiri - ruby parser
2. httpparty - this is to ensure http url
3. byebug - for debugging
4. geocoder - tried but didn't use due to performance
5. redis - redis client for ruby
6. json - json parser
7. csv - csv parser
